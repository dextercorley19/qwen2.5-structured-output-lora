    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the testing and validation of our fine-tuned **Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct** model that has been specifically trained on pitch deck slides using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for efficient fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Model Does:\n",
    "- **Analyzes pitch deck slides** from startup presentations\n",
    "- **Extracts business information** from visual content  \n",
    "- **Understands visual-text relationships** in business contexts\n",
    "- **Provides structured analysis** following learned patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Details:\n",
    "- **Base Model**: Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (3 billion parameters)\n",
    "- **Fine-tuning Method**: LoRA with ultra-lightweight configuration\n",
    "- **Training Data**: 6 pitch deck slides from 3 companies (Icslidedeck1, Brex, LinkedIn)\n",
    "- **Trainable Parameters**: ~460K (0.01% of total model)\n",
    "- **Hardware**: CPU-optimized for Apple Silicon compatibility"
