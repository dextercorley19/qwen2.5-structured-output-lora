# 🚀 Pitch Deck Analysis Pipeline - AI-Powered Business Intelligence

A complete end-to-end pipeline for analyzing startup pitch decks using fine-tuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This project successfully processes PDF pitch decks, extracts business intelligence, and trains custom AI models for automated analysis.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project transforms the traditionally manual process of pitch deck analysis into an automated, AI-powered system. By combining PDF processing, computer vision, and fine-tuned language models, we've created a production-ready pipeline that can analyze startup presentations at scale.

### 🏆 Key Achievements
